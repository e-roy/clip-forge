# Phase 2 — Video Preview Player

> **Goal:** Add a preview player that plays the currently selected clip.
>
> **Tasks:**
>
> 1. Use HTML5 `<video>` element in the center panel.
> 2. Controls: play/pause, current time, duration, scrub bar, volume, mute, and a “fit to window” toggle.
> 3. Selecting a clip in Library loads it into the player. Keep player stateless; selected clip id from global store.
> 4. Keyboard: Space toggles play/pause; `←/→` seek ±1s; `,/.` seek ±1 frame (approx 33ms for 30fps).
>
> **Acceptance Criteria:**
>
> - Selecting a clip shows it in Preview and can play/scrub.
> - Keyboard shortcuts work.
>
> **Run & Test:**
>
> - Import a file; select it; verify smooth playback.
