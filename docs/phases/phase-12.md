# Phase 12 — Final Packaging, README, and Smoke Demo

> **Goal:** Finalize distribution and documentation.
>
> **Tasks:**
>
> 1. Produce signed build for your OS (if certs available). Otherwise unsigned local installer.
> 2. Create `README.md` with:
>
>    - **Overview**, **Tech stack**, **Setup**, **Development**, **Packaging**, **Known issues**, **Keyboard shortcuts**, **MVP demo steps**.
>
> 3. Add a script `npm run demo-seed` to copy 2–3 sample media files into a `samples/` folder (or prompts user to provide).
> 4. Smoke test: follow MVP Testing Scenarios list and note pass/fail.
>
> **Acceptance Criteria:**
>
> - Clean installer launches the app and passes the smoke script.
>
> **Run & Test:**
>
> - Install, import, arrange, trim, export; record a short screen capture; export with PiP.
